QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>관심 있을지 모르겠지만 조그만 의뢰가 들어왔어.
<ce>늑대인간이나, 맷돼지인간 인지 뭔 짐승인간 인지 모르겠지만
<ce>비슷한게 있는 모양이야. 근방에 있는 많은 농부들이
<ce>오랫동안 골치가 아팠던거 같더군. 이걸 죽일 사람이 필요해.
<ce>자네 주머니에 _reward_닢이 들어간단 소리지.
<ce>관심 있나?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>어쩔수 없군. 다른 누가 해야 겠구만.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>훌륭해. ___mondung_에서 그놈을 찾을 수 있을거야.
<ce>=1stparton_일 이내에 잡도록 하게.
<ce>그 다음에 돌아오면 된다, 애송이.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>짐승이 너무 벅찼던 모양이구만, 애송이
<ce>아님 아예 시도도 못해봤나?
<ce>아 뭐, 지금쯤 다른 어딘가로 이동했겠군.
<ce>안타깝구만.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>잘했어, 수인-사냥꾼. 금화 잘 맛보라고.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I've heard there's some kind of werewolf on the loose around here.
<--->
I hear the wereboar's found a lair in someplace called ___mondung_.
<--->
Didja hear that howling last night? Wolf howling?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Werewolves are real nomads, I guess. I hear our loup moved down south.
<--->
My cousin tells me that our wereboar was spotted down south aways.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear they found out that werething was a priest during the day!
<--->
A lot of people feel safer knowing that werebeast is dead.
<--->
You heard about that werewolf some %ra hunted down?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>           Thanks for taking care of that werecritter %pcf.

<ce>                  Get outta here. You're so pathetic.
<ce>                   You couldn't even handle a werewolf.

<ce>                   The lycanthrope threat is ended.

Message:  1021
<ce>                     This must be the "werebeast"
<ce>                      everyone is afraid of. Just
<ce>                       an ordinary grizzly bear.

%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild of
 ___questgiver_ has hired
 me to kill a troublesome werewolf,
 wereboar, or whatever, in its lair,
 ___mondung_. The beast needs
 to be dead in =1stparton_ days
 time for me to collect my payment.

Message:  1080
<ce>                    Here's a map to a place called
<ce>                     ___newdung_.  All the killing
<ce>                      and treasure you can handle.
<ce>                          Knock yourself out.
