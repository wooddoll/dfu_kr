"%qdt: 
 으앙 김밥 존맛I am on a mission from the emperor to investigate
 the shade of King Lysandus. His spirit has been
 haunting the city of Daggerfall. The emperor
 himself has charged me with the duty of laying
 his ghost to rest.
    There is also the minor matter of a letter
 he sent to the Queen of Daggerfall. If I should
 find out what happened to the letter, he would be
 most appreciative.
    Before landing in Daggerfall, a sudden storm
 capsized the ship. I barely made it into this cave."

 I met with Lady Brisienna in a tavern room. She
 told me that the three major powers of the Iliac
 bay are Daggerfall, Wayrest, and Sentinel. If I
 am to investigate the mystery of Lysandus' ghost,
 I should start by speaking with the royal families
 of these fiefdoms.

<ce>              Ah, thank you for responding to my letter,
<ce>                    %pcf. I am Lady Brisienna. Let
<ce>             me bring you to date on affairs. The spectre
<ce>                of King Lysandus haunts the streets of
<ce>              Daggerfall at night. Trying to communicate
<ce>               with him is futile. He will occasionally
<ce>              moan the word "Vengeance", but that is the
<ce>               only coherent word I have ever heard him
<ce>             utter. If you are ever in Daggerfall, do not
<ce>             wander the city at night. You are certain to
<ce>                 be attacked by his legion of ghosts.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                 It would be probably more gainful to
<ce>               investigate those who might have wronged
<ce>            Lysandus to find the cause behind his torment.
<ce>            I do not know if the royal family of Daggerfall
<ce>                or another person or persons merit more
<ce>                suspicion. The major powers of the Bay,
<ce>               Sentinel, Wayrest, and Daggerfall may be
<ce>                         good places to start.

<ce>              In the matter of the letter, the Emperor's
<ce>             agent says that he was unable to hand-deliver
<ce>            it to the Queen because of the war. He hired a
<ce>              courier who supposedly delivered the letter
<ce>             in his stead. We do not even know the name of
<ce>               this courier. Obviously, there is little
<ce>            information of use, but it would be worthwhile
<ce>              to see whether the letter arrived at Castle
<ce>             Daggerfall at all. How you decide to do this
<ce>             is entirely your decision. I will contact you
<ce>                if any new information should surface.
<ce>                                    
<ce>            I am leaving Daggerfall soon. My position here
<ce>            has been compromised and my life is in danger.
<ce>              Do not mention my name in court. It is more
<ce>               likely to hurt than help. Good luck, and
<ce>                        watch your back, %pcf.

Dear %pcn,
 
     I heard about your accident at sea, and feared the
 worst. Now that I've heard you're alive and well, I
 would like the opportunity to meet with you and discuss
 our beloved Emperor's mission in the Iliac Bay.
 
     Allow me to introduce myself. I am Lady Magnessen,
 the Emperor's agent in the court of Daggerfall. My
 position is not so official as an ambassador. None but
 other agents of the Emperor know of my true affiliation.
 The Iliac Bay is rife with rebels against the Imperial
 throne, so your discretion is required.
 
     For the purpose of our meeting, I will take a room
 at an inn, _dirtypit_ in __dirtypit_
 of Daggerfall, for a month. After that, I will no longer
 be available. I will expect you as soon as possible.
 
<ce>                           Yours sincerely,
 
<ce>                       Brisienna, Lady Magnessen

Message:  1021
%pcn,
 
     I sent you a letter weeks ago. I only hope
 it caught up with you. If this one crosses your path
 after you have visited me on your way to see me in
 __dirtypit_ please do not take offense.
 As I mentioned in the previous letter, I am the
 Emperor's agent in Daggerfall and it is imperative
 that I speak with you. I have extend my stay at
 _dirtypit_ in __dirtypit_ for two more weeks.
 
 Of course there is the possibility that you have
 intentionally snubbed me and shirked your duty to
 the Emperor. I hope that is not the case. If you
 fail to arrive, I will be forced to assume you are
 a traitor to his Imperial Majesty, Uriel Septim VII.
 
<ce>                           Yours sincerely,
 
<ce>                       Brisienna, Lady Magnessen

Message:  1022
%pcn,
 
 I waited and you never arrived. I shall report
 this to the Emperor. If I have my way, you will
 be barred from service.
 
<ce>                            Lady Magnessen

<ce>           	You are approached by a young page who smiles in
<ce>             recognition and does not ask your name before
<ce>              he hands you a letter addressed to you. To
<ce>               all of your questions, he merely responds
<ce>                    with a blank look and a smile.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A letter is pressed into your hand. You spin
<ce>            to see who gave it to you. You catch a glimpse
<ce>                of livery that vanishes into the crowd.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A page steps forward saying "Letter for you
<ce>                     %pcn," and hands you a note.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A courier steps up to you with a letter in
<ce>               hand. "I was told to give this letter to
<ce>                someone fitting your description," says
<ce>               the courier. As you take it, the courier
<ce>                     turns and walks quickly away.
                                     <--->
<ce>               Reaching into your pack for something to
<ce>             eat, you spy a note. It wasn't there before.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A redfaced courier startles you with a cry of
<ce>                  "Letter for %pcn! Hey that must be
<ce>                 you. Here, take this. Gotta go. Other
<ce>                        deliveries to be made.

<ce>당신은 잠에서 깨어나 주위를 둘러보았다. 몇 시간 전,
<ce>대거폴로 향하는 배 안에서 본 폭풍은 초자연적인 힘으로 몰아쳐
<ce>일리악만을 흉포한 괴물처럼 끓어 넘치게 했다.
<ce>타고 있던 배는 부서졌지만, 휘몰아치는 바닷물을 뚫고
<ce>곧의 바위까지 헤엄쳐 나올 수 있었다.
<ce>그곳에서 동굴을 발견했고 폭풍을 피해 들어가,
<ce>작은 불을 피우자마자 진흙더미가 쏟아져 내렸다.
<ce>생매장될지도 모른다는 공포는 더 넓은 길로 향하는 통로가 보이자
<ce>사그라들었다. 이 길로 나아가면 동굴을 나갈 수 있을지도 모르며,
<ce>그 후에는 황제께서 내리신 임무를 시작할 수 있을 것이다.
