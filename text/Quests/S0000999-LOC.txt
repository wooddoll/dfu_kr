 황제께서 라이산더스 왕의 유령에 대해 임무를 내리셨다.
 왕의 유령은 대도시 대거폴의 떠돌고 있다고 한다.
 황제께서 영혼을 안식에 들도록 할 것을 나에게 직접 명하셨다.
 그리고 대거폴의 여왕에게 보내졌던 편지에 대한 임무도
 있다. 중요성은 덜하지만 편지가 어떻게 된건지 알아낸다면
 황제께서 매우 기뻐하실 것이다.
 대거폴에 도착하기도 전에 갑자기 몰아닥친 폭풍이 배를
 집어삼켰다. 동굴로 간신히 목숨을 건질 수 있었다.

 브리지엔나 부인을 주점 방에서 만났다.
 일리악만의 강대국은 셋이며 대거폴, 웨이레스트, 센티넬
 이란 것을 알려주었다. 라이산더스의 유령을 조사하려면
 세곳의 왕족들과 대화를 해봐야할 것이다.

<ce>       You are approached by a young page who smiles in recognition
<ce>        and does not ask your name before he hands you a letter
<ce>         addressed to you. To all of your questions, he merely
<ce>                responds with a blank look and a smile.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A letter is pressed into your hand. You spin
<ce>            to see who gave it to you. You catch a glimpse
<ce>                of livery that vanishes into the crowd.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A page steps forward saying "Letter for you
<ce>                     %pcn," and hands you a note.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A courier steps up to you with a letter in
<ce>               hand. "I was told to give this letter to
<ce>                someone fitting your description," says
<ce>               the courier. As you take it, the courier
<ce>                     turns and walks quickly away.
                                     <--->
<ce>               Reaching into your pack for something to
<ce>             eat, you spy a note. It wasn't there before.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A redfaced courier startles you with a cry of
<ce>                  "Letter for %pcn! Hey that must be
<ce>                 you. Here, take this. Gotta go. Other
<ce>                        deliveries to be made.

<ce>                        %pcn, I have a special
<ce>              task in mind for you. However, to be blunt
<ce>             you have yet to prove yourself to me. I don't
<ce>               know if I can trust you yet. I will watch
<ce>            your actions and how you conduct yourself with
<ce>             other members of my court and my family. That
<ce>            will tell me if you have the proper character.
                                     <--->
<ce>              Your bravery and skill are beyond reproach.
<ce>             If I felt I could trust you, I would send you
<ce>            on a particularly sensative mission. Come back
<ce>             and visit me when you shown I can trust you.

<ce>                      %pcn, I have a special task
<ce>            that would be perfect for you. However, I would
<ce>            just be signing your death warrant if I were to
<ce>            give it to you now. When you are more skillful
<ce>              return to me and I may give it to you then.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   Its really too bad, %pcf. I have
<ce>             a special assignment that requires someone I
<ce>            trust, such as yourself. However, it also needs
<ce>             someone of greater skill in order to survive.
<ce>             Come back and visit me when you have improved
<ce>                        your skills some more.

<ce>                      %pcn, You might be just the
<ce>               person ta help me. But I don't trusts ya
<ce>                well nuff yet. If I hears that you are
<ce>                 a standup %ra, maybe you should come
<ce>                        back and ask me again.

Message:  1034
<ce>                    I could sure use yer help %pcn.
<ce>               But you just ain't tough enough ta handle
<ce>              what I gotta have done. You get better and
<ce>                           then come see me.

Message:  1035
<ce>                I have delicate matters that might need
<ce>               your touch. First you must prove yourself
<ce>               worthy. Return to me when you have earned
<ce>                  the trust to deserve my patronage.

Message:  1036
<ce>              You are trustworthy, that I know. However,
<ce>              to be blunt, you are unskilled. Should you
<ce>               gain greater skill and become a deadlier
<ce>               opponent, I think I could give some very
<ce>                           interesting work.

%pcn,
 
    Greetings and salutations. I hope your trip
 was uneventful. They say that you are keenly
 interested in the haunting of Daggerfall. My
 father and King Lysandus were somewhat close.
 Should you come visit me, I might be able to shed
 some light upon recent events involving Lysandus.
 
 Prince Lhotun,
 Castle Sentinel

Message:  1041
Dear %pcf,
 
    My eyes and ears abroad say that you are
 interested in the fate of a certain letter.
 Any emperor should not be so careless, nor should
 a queen. You really should come visit me in
 Castle Wayrest. I have some most interesting
 tidbits that I am sure you would enjoy hearing.
 
<ce>                              -- Morgiah
<ce>                          Princess of Wayrest
